The application models work of OpenFlow software switch and compares it's performance with optimization and without.
The optimization consists of using applications' specific to increase the switch performance.
I create config for each flow table to store a set of match fields that can be used in that table.
Using this config, I setup different hashing function parameters for each table to optimize the performance of switch's past path.

The application is located at ./examples/l2fwd
